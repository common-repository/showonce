ShowOnce Plugin InstructionsInventory Version 1.0
Display notices and or post content once

To display custom ShowOnce post information on a page, simply add our shortcode at the location in the page you would like the ShowOnce post to display. You can see the list of options you can use with ShowOnce below:

Post= (ShowOnce custom post id, example 100, or 100,200,300)
Show= (Once or Dismiss)
style= (ShowOnce custom style id, example 12 etc)
from= (dd/mm/yy)
to= (dd/mm/yy)

[ShowOnce post=100] will dislay the contents of ShowOnce custom post id 100

This is the most basic implentation of ShowOnce. You can simply place this shortcode anywhere you like in your page or post contents and it will display the posts content of whatever ShowOnce custom post id you select.
.
[ShowOnce post=100,200,300] Will display ShowOnce custom post id contents for posts id 100,200 and 300 all at once.

[ShowOnce post=100 show=dismiss] Will display contents of ShowOnce custom post id 100 and will not dissapear until user clicks the dismiss link.
